            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Born in Vernon, BC, I spent my first 10 or so years in Kelowna before moving to Ontario to start Grade 7.
            </p>
            <p>I haven't had many chances to leave the country yet, but I love Canada and, while it has problems, I
                think we can make it a great place to live.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="container">
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I'm currently in the 2-year Computer Programming (PCPRG) program, though I'm exploring my options in
                terms of 'upgrading' to a 4 year degree. I love all aspects of computing and technology, so it's been
                difficult to decide on a specialization.</p>
            <p>After I graduate, I just hope I can secure myself a stable job.. anywhere. In a perfect world, I'd get to
                make pretty, functional, and accessible web designs for a living - the intersection between visual arts,
                complicated technologies and actual real-world impact is very alluring to me. We'll see, though - while
                I don't think AI will take away these jobs entirely, obviously things are a little tough in...
                <em>every</em> market. (I do try to use it as an effort to teach myself new technologies, but I'll be
                honest - for the type of websites I want to make, it's been useless. It likes to take the easy route, it
                can't think about the future very well, etc, etc. Having a boilerplate generator is nice, though. Saves
                me a click to Stack Overflow. <small>Oh, and I'm hoping it is obvious if you actually read the code, but this page is 100% AI free. I consulted MDN and Wendi's documentation mainly, but a lot of this is review. Academic integrity!</small>)
            </p>
            <p>I have a history with freelance - initially making game servers and mods where I grew comfortable with
                Java, Python, and Go. Nowadays, I prefer to take on web projects, but between the frontend and backend,
                there is plenty of variation tools and techniques to keep me interested.</p>
            <p>I even have a <a href="https://github.com/webcrawls">GitHub</a> you can check out! I haven't updated it
                much over the past bit - life has had its plans for me - but I plan to make public the various projects
                and assignments I've had to do for school. You can find my backlog of projets on there, as well.</p>

            <h2>Secondary school</h2>
            <p>I'll keep this section brief. I attended Banting Memorial High School in Alliston, ON for grades 9
                through 12.</p>
            <p>You might be surprised to learn I don't have my OSSD. As of now, I'm just missing my English 12U credit.
            </p>
            <p>My options were: waste away infront of a computer reading Shakespeare (I do actually enjoy reading his
                plays!), or take the MSET test through Sheridan and just move on with my life. I chose option 2 - I'm
                very appreciative of the opportunity to attend Sheridan and live directly in Oakville. 20 minute walk
                from campus!</p>
            <p>I was lucky to make a ton of (hopefully) life-long friends, though!</p>

            <h2>About me</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>I have a cat. Her name is Spot. She is elderly now, but I love her very much. TODO pic.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, she doesn't stay with me right now - a friend and their housemates have been
                        taking very good care of her. Honestly, I'm just glad Spot gets to have other cat friends... I
                        think they annoy her <strikethrough>sometimes</strikethrough>, but it's good to get some
                        socialization, even if you're just a cat.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>You can probably tell programming, and computers in general has been a hobby of mine since I was
                        a kid. But I do other things! Music was my first love; I grew up playing the piano, violin and
                        guitar (shoutout to my Mom for making me go to lessons). Now, my toxic trait is thinking I'll go
                        triple platinum some day. I also have an appreciation for art, and I would like to become a
                        skilled illustrator someday. But, I'm really bad at drawing, so I'm hoping I can pick up some
                        techniques via osmosis - I go to an art school, so...</p>
                    <p>I've also been trying to get into movies lately. I didn't watch many growing up - I watched Lion
                        King for the first time with my roommates a few days ago (as of Jan 2026). I get funny looks but
                        blame my parents not me 😭</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>I try to stay active and fit, but that looks a little different for me compared to the average
                        gym-goer. I'd like to explore more in terms of calisthenics, pylometrics, and yoga going
                        forward. And cardio when I can. People need to do more body weight exercises!</p>

        <article class="container">
            <h2>Anything else?</h2>
            <p>I'm sure I'll think of more to add/share as time marches on. Some day my goal is to evolve this page into
                an actual 'personal site' - I probably have 50+ half-complete portfolio pages, blog sites, etc that I
                never finished, and as my professional career grows, I'll obviously need a proper online presence.</p>
            <p>Some tell me I seem overqualified to be in these first-year courses (and for my Python class I
                wholeheartedly agree - I'm currently begging faculty to let me take the PLAR), but there are little tips
                and tricks that, especially for this web class, I probably would've missed/not thought about/etc. I
                remember racing home to update a client's site when I learned about
                <code>&lt;address&gt;...&lt;/address&gt;</code>, and that was just a brief aside from Wendi.
